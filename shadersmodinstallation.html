    <p>1. Download shadermod library from <a href="https://github.com/GameParrot/mcpelauncher-shadersmod/releases/latest">mcpelauncher-shadersmod releases</a>.</p>
    <p>2. Make sure to match arch for apk that you use in the launcher. For example, <code>x86_64</code>.</p>
    <p>3. Extract the zip.</p>
    <p>4. Open up your mcpelauncher folder. In Linux it would be <code>/home/username/.local/share/mcpelauncher</code> (Alternatively, you can open data folder from the launcher)</p>
    <p>5. Make a new folder named <code>mods</code> and move the newly extracted .so file there.</p>
    <p>6. In <code>/home/username/.local/share/mcpelauncher</code> make another folder named <code>shaders</code> and put all the shader <b>material.bin</b> files there. (You can get those from shader.mcpack /renderer/materials)</p>
    <p>7. Now opening Minecraft from the launcher should load shaders succesfully. (Make sure you're using 1.20.80+ supported shader if you're playing newer versions than that)</p>

    <p><b>How to disable the mod?</b></p>
    <p>1. Add .bak extension to the .so file that you downloaded.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1" >or</p>
    <p>2. Rename the shaders folder to something else. (It doesn't disable the mod but stops the mod from loading shaders)</p>
